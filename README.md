# Portfolio
About A Personal Portfolio is a brokerage account that you own, but as your discretionary investment manager, we manage it for you. MFWM's Personal Portfolios are primarily composed of actively managed, individual securities held in a brokerage account at an approved custodian (currently Interactive Brokers or Schwab).
